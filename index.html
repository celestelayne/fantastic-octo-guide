    <h1>Course Description</h1>
    <p>This is an intermediate-advanced course in creating experimental tools and workflows. We will discuss the history and mechanics of tools used in computer science and user interface design as a method of informing, analyzing and understanding the uses of software, computational tools, and design workflows for architecture and the built environment.</p>
    <p>Students will construct prototype workflows using several computational media (apps, code, scripts, hardware) to create experimental design tools and workflows that change how a designer-developer works. The goal of the class is to deepen our knowledge of computational design and code in addition to understanding that computational design itself can always be re-designed.</p>
