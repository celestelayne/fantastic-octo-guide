# Computational Design Workflows

**Computational Design Workflows** is an intermediate-advanced course in creating experimental tools and workflows. We will discuss the history and mechanics of tools used in computer science and user interface design as a method of informing, analyzing and understanding the uses of software, computational tools, and design workflows for architecture and the built environment.

Students will construct prototype workflows using several computational media (apps, code, scripts, hardware) to create experimental design tools and workflows that change how a designer-developer works. The goal of the class is to deepen our knowledge of computational design and code in addition to understanding that computational design itself can always be re-designed.
