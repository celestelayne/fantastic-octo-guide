## History of Arduino

Arduino is made up of two parts: (1) the Arduino board, a piece of hardware and (2) the IDE, a piece of software run on your computer. You use the IDE to create a sketch (a small computer program) that you then compile and upload to the Arduino board.

#### üèÜ Challenge:  
Use your mobile phone as an extra input control and integrate Arduino / Johnny five by setting up a communication channel between the mobile phone, server and Arduino. For this to work, your mobile phone and Arduino will need to know each other‚Äôs socket ids. Try to control the hardware from your mobile phone?
